This is a simple map generator for DougDoug's peggle roguelike idea from his stream on Oct. 17th.
Feel free to copy this and expand/modify however desired. I'm still learning Python and using this project as a base to add on to.

Features I want to add:
- Interactive map board
    - click on each peg to move through the map
    - hide/unhide each row as you move up to the top (could leave the chapter numbers overlaid on the hidden portion)
    - select the hero to use from the inventory and automatically remove it and add the new hero rewarded from that level
- Randomize layout
    - number of rows
    - numger range of pegs per row
    - links between pegs
- "Integration" with Peggle
    - when clicking on a peg, automatically click through the menus of Peggle Deluxe to select the corresponding level and hero
    - if possible, return success or failure and progress the map respectively
